	Name: spawnBeaconDetector.sqf
	Version: 1.0.0
	Author: soulkobk (soulkobk.blogspot.com)
	Creation Date: 7:05 PM 09/11/2016
	Modification Date: 7:05 PM 09/11/2016
	
	Description:
	For use with A3Wasteland 1.Xx mission (A3Wasteland.com). This is a spawn beacon detector for
	use within A3Wasteland so that players who are equpped with a 'mine detector' can track and
	steal spawn beacons!
	
	When a spawn beacon detector is activated, beeps will sound in the 3d environment (just like a
	real detector) at the player position so that other players within ~100m can also hear the
	player trying to detect spawn beacons. Spawn beacon detectors are no longer silent!
	
	Constant 'beep' sound = facing the correct 'general' direction.
	Constant 'blip-blip' sound = facing the wrong 'general' direction.
